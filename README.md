# bigfiles
This repo exists for storing large data files such as ETW traces or crash dumps, often associated with blog posts

Having public https access to ETW/.etl traces is rather handy, but putting them in a repo with source code would
for those who want the code to have unreasonably large repos. This way people can clone this repo when they need
it or can download individual files.
